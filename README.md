# Prototype of an image recognition engine deployed in a Big Data environment  
Our task is to:
1) Develop an image classification engine for an agritech start-up. This engine recognises a fruit or vegetable by taking its image in input and returning its species in a string format.  
2) Fully deploy this prototype into a big data, RGPD compliant architecture. We deployed this prototype on Amazon Web Services.

This project makes use of Pyspark in order to ensure scalability.
